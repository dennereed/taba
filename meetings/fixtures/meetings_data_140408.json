These models have been applied to explanations of mass extinction, intensification of resource use, and the development of social complexity to name a few.  The ability to determine energetic return rates and prey ranks is essential to the application of the Prey Choice model, however, these data can only be accurately obtained through direct observation or self-report by time conscious individuals.  Because of the usefulness of this model, many archaeologists have made great efforts to determine attribute based proxies for prey ranks.  The most popular and well examined of these is the potential relationship between prey size and prey rank.  Although much of this work has been of the highest quality, it has failed to fully account for the impact of gun hunting on prey ranks.  Gun hunting has been shown to increase return rates from highly ranked prey, which results in a narrowed diet breadth.  By substantially shortening pursuit time, gun hunting should disproportionately increase return rates for large bodied game.  This paper will reanalyze return rate data and control for gun hunting in order to reassess the proposed relationship between size and prey rank for archaeological contexts. It will also propose alternative explanations for patterns in archaeological faunal assemblages which are used to support the size = rank models.

These are the oldest known direct radiocarbon dates on artifacts of this type.  This research was carried out as part of an ongoing project to explore the archaeology and cultural heritage of the Iringa region of southern Tanzania.  During the 2012 field season, seven units were excavated under the modern roof of the shelter.  The top 50cm of deposits in this area were dominated by historic or Iron Age material.  Beneath this, the artifacts change abruptly to a Middle Stone Age (MSA) sequence which continued until reaching bedrock at 180-200cm below surface.  Overall, a total of 93 OES beads and blanks were recovered; three of these were found in the MSA levels.  It is unusual to find OES beads in MSA contexts and only a handful of sites in Africa have reported such associations.  To help rule out taphonomic factors, a sample of OES beads was sent to the Oxford Radiocarbon Accelerator Unit for direct dating.  The dates confirm that the three beads found in association with the MSA occupation indeed belong to that era.  The uncalibrated ages for the MSA beads are 31,810\u00b1180 BP (OxA-27627), 47,750\u00b1750 (OxA-27626), and >50,100 BP (OxA-27628).

However, the discussion of the evolution of the human intellect and specific forces that shaped the underlying brain evolution is as vigorous as it was in Darwin\u2019s times. While studying the neuroscience of conciseness, I was struck with certain facts about mental imagery that seemed to shed some light on the process of the evolution of the human mind. That research resulted in a simple parsimonious theory of the evolution of the human mind that makes clear and testable predictions. I argue that two independent forces drove the evolution of the human brain: First, under the strong selection pressure from stalking motionless predators concealed by the tall savanna grass, our ancestors evolved greater top-down control of perception. Stone tools manufactured by hominins starting 2.6 million years ago indicate that the hominin mind acquired an ability to generate a mental template of the future chopper; their visual system had evolved to actively and intentionally control its percept. At the same time, a greater demand for cooperation influenced the development of a speech box. The archeological and genetic data suggest that as of 600,000 years ago hominins acquired a nearly modern vocal apparatus. When a single mutation around 100,000 years ago triggered the delay of the maturation of the prefrontal cortex, it created a favorable environment for the two developing traits to collude. The synergetic combination of a greater control of perception coupled with a modern speech apparatus resulted in the invention of a syntactic communication system and concomitant acquisition of mental synthesis: the ability to voluntarily imagine any novel object. Armed with the ability to mentally synthesize any novel plan and then to communicate it to their companions, humans quickly became the dominant species.", "created": "2013-10-21", "comments": "The mental synthesis theory is derived from a neuroscientific approach to paleoanthropology. The basis of the theory is a simple, yet fundamental question:  what happens neurologically when two objects, never before seen together (say, an apple on top of a whale), are imagined together for the first time.  We know that a familiar object, such as an apple or a whale, is represented in the brain by a neuronal ensemble.  When one sees or recalls such an object, the neurons of that object\u2019s neuronal ensemble tend to activate into synchronous resonant activity. The neuronal ensemble binding mechanism, based on the Hebbian principle \u201cneurons that fire together, wire together,\u201d came to be known as the binding-by-synchrony hypothesis. However, while the Hebbian principle explains how we perceive a familiar object, it does not explain the infinite number of novel objects that humans can voluntarily imagine. The neuronal ensembles encoding those objects cannot jump into spontaneous synchronized activity on their own since the parts forming those novel images have never been seen together. The author argues that to account for imagination, the binding-by-synchrony hypothesis would need to be extended to include the phenomenon of mental synthesis whereby the brain actively and intentionally synchronizes independent neuronal ensembles into one morphed image. Thus, the apple neuronal ensemble is synchronized with the whale neuronal ensemble, and the two disparate objects are perceived together. The synchronization mechanism of mental synthesis is likely responsible for many imaginative and creative traits that philosophers and scientists have recognized as being uniquely human, despite not having a precise neurological understanding of the process. The article argues that human behavioral modernity is associated with acquisition of mental synthesis and proposes an evolutionary framework for its acquisition.", "abstract_media": "", "last_modified": "2013-10-21", "contact_email": "theandreyv@gmail.com", "abstract_rank": null, "year": 2014, "references": "", "acknowledgements": "", "meeting": 23}}, {"pk": 30, "model": "meetings.abstract", "fields": {"accepted": true, "funding": false, "presentation_type": "Paper", "title": "Out of Beringia:  Genetics, Paleo-ecology, and Archaeology", "abstract_text": "Many human geneticists argue that most Native Americans are derived from a population isolated from its source in Asia for thousands of years before dispersing in the Americas.

Although archaeological traces of LGM occupation in NE Asia and Alaska/Yukon (i.e., accessible remnants of Beringia) are lacking, pre-LGM settlement of northwestern Beringia is documented at sites near the mouth of the Yana River (Pitulko et al. 2012).  \r\n\r\nSeveral lines of evidence indicate a mesic tundra refugium on the Bering Land Bridge (BLB) that may have provided the only substantive source of wood above latitude 55\u00b0 North during the LGM (e.g., Brubaker et al. 2005; Elias and Crocker 2008).  The presence of mesic tundra habitat in central Beringia presumably reflects its geographic position relative to the North Pacific circulation and sources of moisture during the LGM, and may be contrasted with the aridity of unglaciated areas of northern Eurasia ~28\u201318 ka.  Experimental studies indicate that some wood is necessary to render fresh bone practical for regular use as a fuel (Th\u00e9ry-Parisot 2001), and archaeological sites that contain evidence of heavy bone fuel use consistently yield some traces of wood (e.g., Mezhyrich [Marquer et al. 2012]).  \r\n\r\nThe post-LGM archaeological record of Beringia contains an industry derived from NE Asia (Dyuktai) after 15,000 cal BP, but also contains an industry that has no clear antecedent outside Beringia (e.g., Ushki-Layer VII in Kamchatka).

But what mechanism of social learning underpinned traditions of handaxe manufacture? It has been proposed that \u201cimitation,\u201d i.e., the copying of actions leading to a specific \u201cresult,\u201d generate relatively low rates of copying error required in order to sustain long-term cultural traditions in the face of cumulative copying errors. Conversely, \u201cemulation,\u201d i.e., the copying of a result but not the behaviors that have led to that result (\u201cend-state copying\u201d), is allegedly associated with the production of relatively higher rates of copying error. However, to what extent these different social learning mechanisms generate distinct patterns of variation in the archaeological record remains largely unexplored empirically. Here, a controlled experiment was implemented using 60 participants who copied the 3D shape of a \u201ctarget handaxe form\u201d from a standardized foam block. In an \u201cimitation condition,\u201d 30 participants were shown manufacturing techniques employed in the production of the target form and the target form itself. Conversely, in an \u201cemulation condition,\u201d 30 participants were shown only the target form. Morphometrically, copying error rates were statistically different, being significantly lower in the \u201cimitation\u201d condition compared to the \u201cemulation\u201d condition. Moreover, the imitation condition matched the demonstrated behaviors with significantly higher copying fidelity than the alternative condition. These results illustrate that imitation may be imperative for the long-term perpetuation of visibly distinct archaeological traditions, especially in the case of lithic (reductive) traditions, where copying error rates can reasonably be expected to be relatively high (Schillinger et al. 2014).

Factors affecting the utility of such tools would, therefore, have been of concern to hominin populations over the entire timescale of human evolution. Fundamental to the functional utility of simple flake tools is the presence of a relatively acute working edge. The acuteness of this \u201cedge angle\u201d is widely hypothesized to be a primary determinant of cutting efficiency and, subsequently, of potential consequence to hominins. However, there have been no controlled experimental investigations specifically testing the link between working edge angle and cutting efficiency. Moreover, no consideration has been given to whether this relationship is dependent upon the size of the tool. Here, the functional effects of edge angle are examined under controlled experimental conditions, with its relationship to cutting efficiency, loading (i.e. force applied), and overall flake size investigated. Results demonstrate that there is a highly significant relationship between more acute working edges and increased cutting efficiency in the smallest flake tools in our sample. Above a certain flake-size threshold, however, working edge angle had no influence on cutting efficiency because larger flakes facilitate the application of greater working loads.

Evidence from the temporomandibular joint of Middle and Late Pleistocene hominins.\r\n", "abstract_text": "One hypothesis for the distinctive form of the Neanderthal cranium is the anterior dental loading hypothesis (ADLH). However, both support for and against this hypothesis has been generated by biomechanical analyses of the Neanderthal cranium, and it therefore remains unclear what, if any, the adaptive significance of the Neanderthal face for masticatory (or paramasticatory) purposes may have been. As the joint connecting the mandible to the cranium, the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) plays an important role in dissipating masticatory forces and governing mandibular range of motion. Here I present an analysis of the TMJ in H. heidelbergenis, H. neanderthalensis, and H. sapiens with the goal of further evaluating the ADLH. Three-dimensional landmarks describing craniofacial and TMJ shape were collected on a sample of Middle and Late Pleistocene fossil hominins, as well as archaeological samples of modern H. sapiens that are known to have varied in their masticatory behaviors. Standard geometric morphometric techniques were employed to compare TMJ form among taxa (e.g., H. heidelbergensis, H. neanderthalensis, and H. sapiens), and linear measurements describing aspects of TMJ and masticatory shape were extracted to test a series of biomechanical hypotheses. Results revealed few significant differences in linear measures of masticatory and/or TMJ form among H. heidelbergensis and H. neanderthalensis; these results were further mirrored by the geometric morphometric analyses of glenoid fossa form. The shape analyses did, however, successfully distinguish fossil hominins (including fossil H. sapiens) from more recent H. sapiens, potentially suggesting important differences in masticatory function between these groups. Finally, a high occurrence of TMJ pathologies was noted in the Neanderthal sample, with 30% (6/20) of the individuals examined showing signs of TMJ osteoarthritis. This relatively high prevalence of TMJ pathology represents another potential line of evidence for evaluating masticatory function in this fossil species.

However, the discussion of the evolution of the human intellect and specific forces that shaped the underlying brain evolution is as vigorous as it was in Darwin\u2019s times. While studying the neuroscience of consciousness, I was struck with certain facts about mental imagery that seemed to shed some light on the process of the evolution of the human mind. That research resulted in a simple parsimonious theory of the evolution of the human mind that makes clear and testable predictions. I argue that two independent forces drove the evolution of the human brain. First, under the strong selection pressure from stalking motionless predators concealed by the tall savanna grass, our ancestors evolved greater top-down control of perception. Stone tools manufactured by hominins starting 2.6 million years ago indicate that the hominin mind acquired an ability to generate a mental template of the future chopper; their visual system had evolved to actively and intentionally control its percept. At the same time, a greater demand for cooperation influenced the development of a speech box. The archeological and genetic data suggest that as of 600,000 years ago hominins acquired a nearly modern vocal apparatus. When a single mutation around 100,000 years ago triggered the delay of the maturation of the prefrontal cortex, it created a favorable environment for the two developing traits to collude. The synergetic combination of a greater control of perception coupled with a modern speech apparatus resulted in the invention of a syntactic communication system and concomitant acquisition of mental synthesis: the ability to voluntarily imagine any novel object. Armed with the ability to mentally synthesize any novel plan and then to communicate it to their companions, humans quickly became the dominant species.", "created": "2013-11-19", "comments": "The mental synthesis theory is derived from a neuroscientific approach to paleoanthropology. The basis of the theory is a simple, yet fundamental question:  what happens neurologically when two objects, never before seen together (say, an apple on top of a whale), are imagined together for the first time.  We know that a familiar object, such as an apple or a whale, is represented in the brain by a neuronal ensemble.  When one sees or recalls such an object, the neurons of that object\u2019s neuronal ensemble tend to activate into synchronous resonant activity. The neuronal ensemble binding mechanism, based on the Hebbian principle \u201cneurons that fire together, wire together,\u201d came to be known as the binding-by-synchrony hypothesis. However, while the Hebbian principle explains how we perceive a familiar object, it does not explain the infinite number of novel objects that humans can voluntarily imagine. The neuronal ensembles encoding those objects cannot jump into spontaneous synchronized activity on their own since the parts forming those novel images have never been seen together. The author argues that to account for imagination, the binding-by-synchrony hypothesis would need to be extended to include the phenomenon of mental synthesis whereby the brain actively and intentionally synchronizes independent neuronal ensembles into one morphed image. Thus, the apple neuronal ensemble is synchronized with the whale neuronal ensemble, and the two disparate objects are perceived together. The synchronization mechanism of mental synthesis is likely responsible for many imaginative and creative traits that philosophers and scientists have recognized as being uniquely human, despite not having a precise neurological understanding of the process. The article argues that human behavioral modernity is associated with acquisition of mental synthesis and proposes an evolutionary framework for its acquisition.\r\n\r\nNote, that this is the revision of the previously submitted abstract.

These animal groups show some similarities to known chimpanzee lithic behaviour, including a focus on pounding activities, selective transport and accumulation of natural materials, and group-level adoption of technological traditions. However, there are also striking differences: the macaques use stone tools primarily to exploit shellfish instead of plant foods, and they live on intertidal coasts, while the capuchins use stones for digging and have been observed deliberately fracturing pebbles.

The occurrence of YTT at Pinnacle Point extends the area covered by distal tephra and suggests that YTT may be found at other MSA sites in southern Africa. This discovery is important in that it may help resolve the dating controversy arising from substantially different age estimates provided by different luminescence researchers for MSA sites in South Africa.   The Toba tephra provides a widespread isochronous marker that can be used to independently test age estimates from luminescence techniques.

This is unfortunate because in some cases they are the only teeth represented at important paleoanthropological sites (e.g. Blombos, Cavallo).  The deciduous teeth are thought to strongly reflect an individual\u2019s underlying genotype since they develop early during ontogeny and their final expression is influenced even less by environment than are the permanent teeth.  The crown and cervical outlines of deciduous upper first and second and lower second molars have shown to be diagnostically different between Homo sapiens and H. neanderthalensis, but the lower first molar (dm1) has yet to be studied in this context. This study used elliptical fourier and linear discriminant analyses to examine the discriminatory power of the lower dm1 outline of Neandertals (n=13), fossil (n=13) and recent H. sapiens (n=189).  Of particular interest is a child from Barakai Cave (Caucasus) represented by a mandible with a complete deciduous dentition.  The mandible was previously assigned to H. neanderthalensis (Faerman et al, 1994) based on the sizes of the corpus and the teeth, as well as the possession of thin enamel and taurodont roots. However, the occlusal morphology of the deciduous second molar (dm2) is ambiguous, possessing an interrupted, rather than continuous, middle trigonid crest.  Our results show that lower dm1 outline discriminates even better between H. neanderthalensis and H. sapiens than does that of the lower dm2. Our analysis of the Barakai deciduous molar outlines confirm its status as H. neanderthalensis: a discriminant analysis shows a 92% posterior probability of belonging to H. neanderthalensis based on dm1 and 88% based on dm2.  Recent radiocarbon dating of fauna associated with the mandible place it between 38-40 Ka.  Thus, the Barakai child joins Mezmaiskaya as a late surviving member of H. neanderthalensis in this region.

They maintained that such transformations could potentially alter the original phylogenetic hypotheses concerning Au. sediba, including its status as a distinct species.  Here we present a reconstruction and developmental simulation of the MH1 cranium using 3D geometric morphometric techniques.  First, damage to the fossil was corrected  using a synchrotron scan of MH1. To estimate growth trajectories for comparative ape species, scans were obtained from male and female individuals with second molars erupted, and from male and female individuals with third molars erupted, from the following: chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes), gorillas (Gorilla gorilla), and humans (Homo sapiens).  All scans were used to place an array of 3D landmarks and semilandmarks.  Growth vectors for each species were then applied to the original coordinates collected from MH1, to produce coordinates for the simulated adult cranium.  Using thin-plate spline transformations in Landmark Editor\u00ae software, the MH1 cranium was morphed into these coordinates to produce a rendering of the adult specimen.  The majority of morphological changes expected to occur between second and third molar eruption appear to be related to the development of secondary sexual characteristics.  Most significant changes are observed in the male gorilla growth vector, in which we see increased development of the glabella and supraorbital torus, combined  with thickening of the zygomatic. This was also observed, to a lesser extent, using the chimpanzee growth vector.  However, changes observed for that of the human growth vector were minimal.

This study presents a predictive method combining cladistics and geometric morphometrics that computes 3D morphotypes of possible last common ancestors (LCA) of a phylogeny. Here we focus on the genus Homo and on the Middle Pleistocene divergence between H. sapiens and H. neanderthalensis. A simple structural phylogenetic pattern is used to distribute terminal taxa represented by 3D models of crania described by 420 semi-landmarks.\r\nThe landmarks are aligned and scaled using a Generalized Procruste Analysis (EVAN Toolbox v. 1.63) before being used as continuous variables presenting three components: the spatial coordinates (x,y,z). We use the squared-change parsimony principle (maximum parsimony method which minimizes the total number of evolutionary transformations to reconstruct cladograms) to compute the ancestral state of the 420 semi-landmarks at all nodes in the tree; that is, the coordinates of each landmark for the hypothetical ancestor (Mesquite, v. 2.75). From this 3D shape we reconstruct the putative LCA of H. sapiens and H. neanderthalensis as a fully-rendered virtual 3D model (landmark-guided surface warping). Using 3D geometric morphometrics, we compare the virtual LCA to a dataset of 3D landmarks of Pleistocene hominin fossils including Middle Pleistocene specimens that could represent the ancestral population of modern humans and Neandertals.\r\nOur results show that the virtual LCA is similar to Middle Pleistocene fossils and especially to African specimens such as Kabwe and Bodo, suggesting that the Middle Pleistocene population ancestral to modern humans and Neandertals may have been African. Additionally, we demonstrate that this method can be successfully applied to simulate ancestral nodes in human evolutionary phylogenies.

European Late Paleolithic and Mesolithic hunter-gatherers mainly show flat wear pattern, while oblique molar wear has been reported as characteristic of early agriculturalists from the Neolithic (e.g., Smith 1984). \r\nHere we quantify molar wear patterns and ET topographic distributions in the French Neolithic necropolis from Gurgy, with the expectation that high masticatory forces on tooth location will lead to selection for greater ET. Gurgy has been used continuously around thousand years (ca. 5000-4000 cal. BC) and is situated at the crossroads of multiple cultural influences. As a comparative population having experienced other masticatory and/or dietary conditions, we used a French medieval sample. \r\nOcclusal wear was recorded in second upper permanent molars (UM2) of 64 Neolithic individuals and 311 comparative medieval UM2s. Using a microtomographic-based record (Skyscan 1076 X-ray microtomograph; voxel size: 17.93-36.18 \u00b5m3), we virtually assess ET topographic distribution in sub-samples of 17 Neolithic and 25 medieval UM2s.\r\nDifferences in wear patterns and ET topography were found between the Neolithic and medieval samples. Oblique wear is largely dominant in the Neolithic sample (87%), while medieval UM2s show greater variation and only 41% of oblique wear. For the Neolithic population, maximal ET is precisely localized where occlusal wear is the most important, whereas medieval ET topography is more homogeneously distributed.\r\nThese results suggest that ET could be affected by a selective pressure caused by functional dietary changes, notably by those reported for the transition to agriculture.

After a thorough investigation, the researchers assigned both skeletons to a new species, which they named Australopithecus sediba. According to our analysis, the spinal columns of the two skeletons represent two different hominid genera: Australopithecus and Homo. Unlike Homo, australopiths exhibit a ventrodorsal length of the vertebral bodies that is relatively short when compared to the height of the vertebrae (their craniocaudal length); the vertebral canal is large in relation to the AP dimension of the vertebral bodies; and the articular processes are relatively large. \r\nWe compared these ratios in the four lumbar vertebrae from Malapa to the ratios that characterize the lumbar elements of 75 modern humans, two Homo erectus specimens, and four australopiths. Our measurements indicate that the lumbar vertebrae attributed to the Malapa specimen MH-1 (UW88-92 and UW88-152) fall well within the range of Homo, whereas the lumbar vertebrae attributed to the Malapa specimen MH 2 (UW88 127/153 and UW88 126/138) are similar to those found in Australopiths.\r\nThese findings are in perfect agreement with the mandibular evidence provided by the Malapa specimens and again suggest that the hypodigm of \"Australopithecus sediba\" consists of a typical Homo mandible and an australopith. The claim that A. sediba represents a transitional species between Australopithecus africanus and Homo stems from this mixture.

We use craniometric data to examine morphological diversity in pre- and post-LGM samples. Craniometric variation was assessed across four periods - pre-LGM, late glacial, Early Holocene and Middle Holocene - using a large, comprehensive, and well-dated dataset. In compiling the dataset, particular attention was paid to the comparability of measurement protocols employed by different researchers, the archaeological ascription of sites, and new information regarding the dating of particular sites and/or specimens. We employed size-adjustment via the geometric mean to remove scaling effects due to sexual dimorphism and potential differences in robusticity. We then applied multivariate statistical methods to assess the degree and nature of any differences among the four groups. \r\nA MANOVA on size-adjusted cranial measurements found significant differences across the four periods. A linear discriminant analysis showed the major separation to be between pre-LGM and later groups along the first discriminant function. Post-LGM groups were all clustered together and were substantially distant from pre-LGM specimens as measured using Mahalanobis distances. The pre- and post-LGM discrepancy was driven mostly by facial measurements, which is consistent with hypotheses of climatically driven selection. However, we cannot rule out the possibility of stochastic evolutionary forces due to glacial refugia, population fragmentation, and genetic drift.

In the initial publication, it was suggested that the site included a Mesolithic assemblage with a Levallois component. Dolukhanov passed away in 2007 and the research in the cave was halted. We resumed excavation in the cave in 2013 under a joint American-Armenian expedition.  Here we present the preliminary results from this study. \r\nThe cave is formed by a lave tube and is believed to be a unique structure in its environment. The pedogenesis within the cave is shallow, but includes four different soil layers in a depth of ca. 70 cm.  A large UP lithics assemblage found in strata C, prepared solely on obsidian, is similar to Dzudzuana. The assemblage consisted mostly of debitage with a complete chain op\u00e9ratoire, but no tools.  Tools were identified in the assemblages collected by Dolukhanov, which indicates that their absence is a product of sample size.   A MP assemblage was uncovered from stratum D. The assemblage was made entirely from basalt, with mostly non-diagnostic tools. Tools were indicative of Levallois technique on blades. Unfortunately, no carbon material was available for 14C and current research is focusing on other dating methods, obsidian sourcing and regional GPR. \r\nThese results point to the presence of a stratified MP-UP site in Northern Armenia and its potential to shed light on the Middle to Upper Paleolithic transition in this critical time in human evolution.\r\n", "created": "2013-12-01", "comments": "", "abstract_media": "", "last_modified": "2013-12-01", "contact_email": "miriam-belmaker@utulsa.edu", "abstract_rank": null, "year": 2014, "references": "", "acknowledgements": "Funding for this research was made possible from Faculty Internationalization and Faculty Research Grants from the University of Tulsa for MB.

Two different sets of toolstone properties are thought to influence artefact form. The first set is internal, and related to mechanical flaking properties. The second set is external, namely the form (size, shape, presence of cortex) of the initial nodule or blank from which flakes are struck.  We conducted a replication experiment under controlled conditions to determine whether handaxe morphology was influenced by raw materials of significantly different internal and external properties: flint, basalt, and obsidian.  The knapper was instructed to copy a model handaxe, produced by a different knapper, 35 times in each toolstone type (n = 105 handaxes).  To ensure that learning over time did not confound results in any one raw material, the knapper produced one flint, basalt, and obsidian handaxe, in turn, each day for 35 days.  The same set of knapping tools was used throughout.  On each experimental handaxe, 29 size-adjusted (scale-free) morphometric variables were recorded to capture the shape of each handaxe in order to compare them to the model.  Both Principal Components Analysis (PCA) and a Multivariate Analysis of Variance (MANOVA) were used to determine if raw material properties were a primary determinate of patterns of overall shape differences across the toolstone groups. The PCA results demonstrated that variation in all three toolstones was distributed evenly around the model \u201ctarget\u201d form. The MANOVA of all 29 size-adjusted variables, using two different tests (Pillai\u2019s Trace and Wilks\u2019 Lambda), showed no statistically significant differences in overall shape between the three groups of raw material.

Various hypotheses have been presented to explain this peculiar nature of human genetic diversity, including models that suggest a significantly low amount of gene flow between small regional populations of early humans during the Pleistocene. While these models may work in principal, they are rarely tested against the anthropological record. Here, I test models that attempt to explain the low genetic diversity and low effective population size of Homo sapiens. I show how the ethnographic & fossil data can help geneticists test their models. I derive expectations as to how the anthropological data should be pattern if these genetic models are an accurate depiction for human behavior. I show that the archaeological data is slightly patterned in the expected way: information follows between populations in ways expected based upon mediated migration. However, neither the skeletal data nor the ethnographic support the tested hypothesis. Instead, it is argued that models predicated on effective population size often misuse this genetic parameter. This study is unique in its use of multiple lines of anthropological data to test a genetic model of human evolution. This work has implications both for the understanding of human evolution and for the renewed relevance of the intersection of cultural and biological anthropology as it tests the paleoanthropological record against ethnographic reality in an informative way.

Analysis of the total assemblage is ongoing; we report here on the teeth and associated cranial/mandibular fragments (NISP = 825).  The range of identified species is comparable to that from other Middle and Upper Paleolithic sites in the region and includes gazelle, goat, roe deer, fallow deer, red deer, and wild boar, as well as smaller animals such as rock hyrax and red fox.  Gazelle dominates the assemblage (NISP = 521; MNI > 30). Notably, these fragments have been assigned to Gazella sp. because a preliminary analysis of the horn cores indicated the presence of both Gazella gazella (mountain gazelle) and Gazella subguttarosa (goitered gazelle).  Wear stages for the lower fourth premolars and lower molars were assigned based on the scheme in Munro et al. (2009).

It is more likely that hominins and other species would have responded to climatic variability on shorter temporal and smaller spatial scales. To address the issue of scale, multiple proxies from a local paleoenvironment, including stable isotope signals from pedogenic carbonates (n=86), the abundance of fossil mammals (n=951), and facies context, are used to quantify the extent of ecological change between the periods above and below the Tulu Bor Tuff (3.44 Ma) in the East Turkana region, northern Kenya. Global climate records suggest that the period below the Tulu Bor (~3.7\u20133.44 Ma) is more humid than the younger period above the Tulu Bor Tuff (~3.44 \u2013 3.2 Ma). Data from this study demonstrate a significant difference in mammalian community structure across the Tulu Bor Tuff in East Turkana, where mammalian diversity decreases in the younger sediments corresponding to the less humid global climate regime. However, the carbon isotopes signals demonstrate no significant differences in mean or variance between the two periods, whereas oxygen isotope means do differ significantly. Though the results from these proxies demonstrate a correlation between mammalian diversity and global humid and dry periods, they also correspond with local events such as the extended volcanic activity that resulted in the deposition of the Tulu Bor Tuff, and may have affected the local ecology of the region.

The sample of habitual climbers to non-climbers were asked to participate in a survey and self-assessment of physical activity that included climbing abilities, a push up test and a bone density scan (Dual-energy X-ray Absorptiometry, DEXA).

Higher bone mineral density at the humerus and shoulder was seen among the practiced climbers when compared to the non-climbers.

Several methods employing measurements from stencils have been developed, often with conflicting results. Here we present a methodologically and statistically robust means of predicting sex using geometric morphometrics to quantify sexually dimorphic shape variation reflected in hand stencils.\r\nExperimental replication of hand stencils comparable with Palaeolithic homologues was carried out leading to 264 hand outlines (106 males; 158 females). Digital images were captured, with 19 landmarks applied to each stencil. Following the methodology of Randolph-Quinney et al. 2010, landmark configurations were subjected to Generalized Procrustes Analysis and post-hoc tests using R. Shape variation was investigated, with discriminant function analysis being used to investigate patterns of sexual dimorphism. Exact randomization and partial least squares tests were further applied in order to examine covariation and modularity in hand shape. \r\nThe results indicate that when both shape and size are factored into the analysis this method can predict the sex of an individual, with successful classification ranging between 85% and 91%, depending on which anatomical region is sampled. The technique allows sex-assessment based on stencils of the whole hand, the digits, the palm, or isolated parts of each. \r\nThis integrated approach offers significant discriminating power in predicting the sex of individuals from hand stencils, exceeding the predictive power of other methods. Furthermore, preliminary analysis indicates that this approach is also able to accommodate incomplete stencils (i.e., when digits are missing or bent-over).

Starch grains can become damaged and destroyed by several physical and chemical processes, in particular, due to cooking and processing (e.g. Henry et al. 2009, Crowther 2012), and are therefore especially vulnerable to post-depositional taphonomic processes. We are currently carrying out experimental work to study changes to the morphology of starch as a factor of time, as well as quantitative variation as a result of decay during burial. For this purpose, we have seeded flint tools with three varieties of starches (wheat, potato and cattail), using both native and cooked starches, and buried them in different environmental and climatic contexts that mimic those found at archaeological sites for a period of three years. Our main research question is to determine how different parameters in soil chemistry, including temperature, pH, nutrient and mineral content, water availability and movement, and bacterial load, affect the preservation of starches under different climatic conditions. The results from this project will help indicate environments in which we should expect to see good starch preservation. Here we present the results obtained after one year of burial.

Despite the importance of plant foods, we know surprisingly little about the wild edible plant species in the areas relevant to human evolution. Habitat reconstructions of fossil-bearing sites suggest that early hominins lived in a variety of habitats, from forest to wetland. We assume that certain habitats may have been more welcoming to a hominin with an ape-like diet, but have little information about the edible foods, particularly their nutritional and mechanical properties, present in these environments. Without this information, it is difficult to accurately reconstruct aspects of early hominin behavioral ecology, such as patch choice, diet breadth and habitat preference.\r\n\r\nWe have explored this question by documenting the availability and abundance of potential plant foods in several South African microhabitats within the Cradle of Humankind World Heritage Site, including wetland, woodland and open grassland, and have compared the nutritional properties and abundance of antifeedants of these plants across habitats and between seasons. We collected the dominant grass, sedge, tree and forb species from each habitat and have measured their mechanical properties, phytolith abundance, and percentages of crude protein, fiber, lipids and lignins. Preliminary results suggest that phytolith content is highest in the wetlands, probably due to the abundance of sedges in this habitat. Among grasses, those with the highest nutritional value also have the highest phytolith content, thus increasing the mechanical cost of consumption and digestion of these plants. Plants in the open woodland have highest protein levels, while those in the riverside habitat have highest lignin.

The practice is recorded amongst people from different latitudes (Greenland1,2,3,4 to Kenya5 to Australia6), with different subsistence strategies (hunter gatherers1-4,6 and pastoralists5), and with a wide variety of prey (birds, mammals, herbivores, omnivores, and carnivores3,4,7).

These sources can be unreliable as they may tend towards the sensationalist, and to be tinged with prejudice against what were considered \u2018savage\u2019 practices1. Conversely, where recent authors mention gastrophagy it is typically as an aside, an observation marginal to the main aim of the research e.g.9. Little detail is therefore provided in terms of frequency, seasonality, demographic factors, species composition, and relative dietary contribution. With these factors unclear, the real importance of gastrophagy to human groups remains uncertain. Here we discuss gastrophagy in a group of contemporary East African foragers (the Hadza of Tanzania) with a very well studied diet in order to put gastrophagy into context. We then consider the implications of gastrophagy in hominin evolution. It was recently suggested that, given the prevalence of gastrophagy in non-farming groups, and the clear nutritional advantages of herbivore chyme in a vegetation-poor environment, gastrophagy may have been practiced by Neanderthals10. Given evidence from the Hadza that gastrophagy also occurs amongst recent humans living in warm climates, we consider the implications of the practice in earlier hominins living in Africa. If gastrophagy occurred at a significant level in meat-eating Australopithecus or Homo species, plant remains from their (hunted or scavenged) herbivorous prey could potentially confound hominin dietary interpretations based on evidence such as toothwear, calculus, lithic residues, trace, and isotope analyses .", "created": "2013-12-02", "comments": "", "abstract_media": "", "last_modified": "2013-12-02", "contact_email": "l.buck@nhm.ac.uk", "abstract_rank": null, "year": 2014, "references": "1)\tNansen, F. 1893.

Foraging experiments were conducted with Khoe-San descendants in the area and hourly caloric net return rates were recorded over 35 low tides and through the seasons.   Net return rates varied as a function of gender, tidal range, marine habitat types and condition of surf. The mean net return rate (kcal/hour) in some instances equals or exceeds that recorded for hunting of large mammals, and shows that under the right conditions the south coast provides an extraordinarily rich protein resource.

Bovids occupying structurally distinct habitat types differ in their astragalar anatomy, and these differences are significant after controlling for body size and phylogenetic signal (Barr, 2013). In total, 234 astragali from Shungura were analyzed using measurements previously shown to relate to habitat preference. Mesowear was scored for 559 molars following published protocols.  Mesowear is a predictor of diet, differentiating between abrasion-dominated grazers with low-blunt cusps and attrition-dominated browsers with high-sharp cusps. \r\n\r\nCarbon isotope values for some Shungura Tragaphines are higher than in any known extant relatives (Bibi et al., 2013).

Furthermore, the ecological differences between Member E and Member F (ca. 2.36 Ma) appear similar in magnitude to the earlier shift.

The Pleistocene deposits at Karungu include >9 meters of fluvial and alluvial sediments with well-developed vertic (Vertisol-like) paleosols and three chemically distinct tephras, the basal-most of which probably derived from East African Rift System volcanoes that began erupting ~100,000 years ago. Paleosol morphologies and bulk geochemical proxies, together with faunal community composition, indicate a seasonal, semi-arid climate (precipitation = ~700 to 900 mm/year) that was drier than today (~1200 mm/year), likely driving a substantial reduction in the surface area of Lake Victoria. The reduction in precipitation was associated with an expansion of C4 grasslands, as evidenced by the dominance of grassland species in the micro- and macro-mammalian fossil assemblages and by stable isotopic analysis of tooth enamel, which demonstrates that mammalian herbivores primarily consumed C4 vegetation. Several ungulate species with historically allopatric ranges co-occur at Karungu, suggesting that the expansion of grasslands and the reduction in Lake Victoria facilitated mammalian dispersals across equatorial East Africa, consistent with predictions from genetic evidence. Regional archaeological evidence further suggests that vegetation shifts played a role in mediating the dispersal of MSA technological markers across the Lake Victoria Basin, perhaps indicating past human dispersals.

The increase in brain size that began over 2 million years ago and continued through the appearance of modern humans is often associated with our increasing carnivory. However, the significance of this niche expansion cannot be appreciated without an understanding of the nature of hominin carcass acquisition capabilities, which at some point after 1.8 mya began to include hunting.  Whether this behavioral shift occurred before or after the emergence of the Acheulean remains unclear due to the inadequate sample of fossil assemblages that have been studied from this time period. The Olduvai Geochronology and Archaeology Project (OGAP) is addressing this deficiency by examining archaeological sites deposited before and after the Oldowan/Acheulean transition at Olduvai Gorge, Tanzania. The HWK EE site comprises part of this sample and represents a period just prior to the appearance of Acheulean technology at Olduvai. \r\n\r\nHWK EE is an Oldowan site that lies on top of Tuff IIA, indicating it was deposited roughly 1.7 mya.

We present the results of the analysis of more than 14,000 lithic artifacts from the sequence to examine aspects of change and continuity in raw material selection and heat-treatment, core reduction strategies, and tool types through time. At PP5-6, fine-grained raw materials (i.e., silcrete, quartz, chalcedony) dominate the assemblage after ~70 ka. Quartzite is more common ~90-70 ka, though some stratigraphic units during this period are silcrete-dominant. Quartz use peaks between ~70-63 ka. Based on the size-variability of lithic artifacts with remnant pre-heat treatment scars, silcrete nodules of various sizes and morphologies were heat-treated. Diverse core reduction methods were used throughout the sequence for blade, bladelet, and flake production, and these methods included the use of minimally-crested blades, pyramidal blade cores, and bipolar percussion.

Using multiple habitat proxies, this study provides a preliminary paleoecological reconstruction of two fossiliferous collection areas from Woranso-Mille (Aralee Issie and Mesgid Dora).

Mesowear analysis reveals that ungulates with all dietary types (grazers, leaf and fruit browsers, and mixed feeders) were present in nearly equal proportions. Ecomorphological analyses using linear measurements of the astragalus and phalanges indicate that bovids utilizing locomotor behaviors associated with all habitat types were present, though lighter cover habitats are better represented in the sample (57% open and light cover specimens versus 38% closed and heavy cover specimens). Ecomorphological analyses using geometric morphometrics of astragli and metatarsals support this conclusion. Geometric morphometric analysis of the plantar margin of the third phalanx demonstrates that bovids adapted to all substrate conditions less mountainous are represented.

However, cumulative stress during crown development is also discernible through the analysis of dental fluctuating asymmetry (DFA), and a study by Barrett and colleagues (2012) demonstrated that DFA was highest among Neandertals when compared to several recent human groups (Inupiat, Ohio Late Archaic and Protohistoric groups, and modern Ohioans). The present study aims to contextualize these results within the context of the Middle to Upper Paleolithic transition by providing a further comparison with 22 early modern humans (~40-20 ka cal BP). Following Barrett et al. (2012), DFA index values were calculated for the early modern human sample and converted to z-scores. DFA index values were then compared to the published values for Neandertals and recent humans. Results show that DFA index values are highest among the Neandertals (absolutely highest for 7 of 16 tooth positions), but early modern humans did have the highest overall values for 3 of 16 tooth positions.

These results support previous DEH and DFA research suggesting that Neandertals were under considerably more developmental stress than anatomically modern humans.

The category of a sloped nasal floor has also been discussed as being potentially problematic (Franciscus 2003), and is not included in all analyses of this trait. Quantification of nasal floor configuration was previously limited by a lack of technology for landmarking internal surfaces and a lack of a methodology for quantifying curves or surfaces. This project quantifies nasal floor shape using 2D and 3D sliding semi-landmark analyses using clinical CT scans of extant humans (n=80) and 3D surface renderings taken from a sample of original fossil Homo specimens.

Sloped nasal floors (which were correctly classified only 60% of the time) showed a greater tendency to be misclassified as flat than as depressed. A 2D relative warps analysis (RWA) focused exclusively on nasal floor shape showed variation in topography that focused on mid-floor curvature (or lack thereof) and only RW3 (which represented 14.6% of the total variation) was correlated (p=0.0171) with the visually coded nasal floor scores, implying that some nasal floor shape variation is not captured by the traditional assessment method.

Relative to the earlier two geologic members (i.e., Upper Burgi and KBS), this period documents a significant carbon enrichment and oxygen depletion in the isotopic signature of Homo that is not observed in other contemporary mammalian taxa, including Paranthropus. In addition, archeological sites within the Okote Member possess unusually high proportions of size class 3 grazing mammals relative to their overall abundance in this member. Thus, it is our hypothesis that the change in the isotopic signature of Homo c1.5 million years ago is the consequence of consuming significant amounts of meat obtained from large-bodied C4 grass-eating herbivores. \r\n", "created": "2013-12-02", "comments": "", "abstract_media": "", "last_modified": "2013-12-02", "contact_email": "dbpatter@gwmail.gwu.edu", "abstract_rank": null, "year": 2014, "references": "", "acknowledgements": "", "meeting": 23}}, {"pk": 87, "model": "meetings.abstract", "fields": {"accepted": true, "funding": false, "presentation_type": "Paper", "title": "Building the climate context of the Acheulean and Middle Stone Age of East Africa: the Olorgesailie Drilling Project", "abstract_text": "In September 2012, drill cores reaching the local basement of the East African Rift were obtained from the southern Olorgesailie Basin, Kenya.

Multi-sensor logging indicates variation potentially related to precessional cycles. Numerous tephra were sampled, enabling high-precision 40Ar/39Ar chronology coupled with correlations to nearby archeological and faunal sites. The cores show intervals of varve-like lake strata interspersed with regressive phases in a near-shore setting. More than two dozen proxy records are in development, including diatoms, phytoliths, palynomorphs, leaf-wax biomarkers, ostrocodes, charcoal, organics, carbonates, and other geochemical indicators. Initial datasets will assess seasonal-to-orbital-scale climate variability, and test a recently proposed model of high- and low-climate variability and its influence on hominin evolution. A unique challenge is to integrate the core and outcrop data to model resource landscapes, ecological variability, hominin responses, and factors that affected selection, extinction, and population divergence in a region where important evolutionary events are documented. \r\n\r\nProject members: R.

However, the potential for linking behavior and ecology to cutmarks is currently limited due to our poor understanding of cutmark patterning as measured by the frequency, orientation and distribution of cutmarks over larger mammal skeletons.

The 5m deep undisturbed sediment has recently been dated by magnostratigraphy to >0.78 Ma (Matuyama megnetochron). Past excavation has revealed thermally altered sediment, chert and calcined bone from within a deep, sealed layer.  The research discussed herein substantiates claims of cultivated fire use at this site through analysis of heat altered micromammalian bone.  Taphonomic analysis conducted on micromammalian remains (individuals < 5kg in weight) from within, above, and below the thermally altered layer indicates that temperatures exceeding those occurring in natural fires (>600oC) occurred throughout the altered layer.  The intensity of heating is evidenced by drastic discolouration of non-anthropically deposited small mammal bones. Five grades of heat-induced discolouration were recognized through the sample, with only 3% of category 5 (calcined) bone occurring outside of the burnt layer. Electron microscopy of bone fragments attributes this discolouration to burning rather than post-depositional mineral staining, however, a distinctive form of manganese staining has been recognized throughout the sample.  Interpretation of the agent responsible for the micromammal sample accumulation, based on element representation, breakage patterning and acid etching, suggests that these bones were deposited by non-human avian predators prior to the burning event.

Given recent fossil hominin discoveries, the autapomorphic status of the Neandertal body pattern perhaps requires some revision. The present study first examined the degree to which Plio-Pleistocene hominins, including Neandertals, possess body plans that consist of trunks and pelves that were both absolutely wide (i.e., the dimensions of the trunk and pelvis scaled together tightly). Then, a sample of modern humans (n=98) was used to investigate the relationships and patterns of scaling between body size and variables related to the size and shape of the chest and pelvis, in order to determine whether the modern human pattern differs from that of fossil hominins.  Results suggest that modern humans, instead of Neandertals, possess a derived pattern that is more variable in terms of how the dimensions of the upper and lower trunk scale with one another, as well as with body size.

Bone breakage analysis usually can determine the timing of breakage (as fresh, dry, or fossil bone) and aims at identifying agents of breakage (e.g. hominins, carnivores, trampling, compaction in sediments). Crenulated breaks associated with tooth pits on spongy bone/ long bone epiphyses indicate carnivore breakage, but identifying causes of breakage on long bone shafts is more problematic if tooth or hammerstone pits are not preserved or are covered by matrix.  Studies of notches and breaks on shaft fragments have suggested that carnivore tooth loading results in more perpendicular break angles, while hammerstone dynamic loading leads to more oblique breakage angles (Capaldo and Blumenschine, 1994,  Alc\u00e1ntara-Garcia et al. 2006), but variation due to variables such as size class, shapes and thickness of skeletal elements, location of impact, degree of force applied, and even taxonomic group (de Juana, S. and Dom\u00ednguez-Rodrigo, M. 2011) means that large scale controlled studies are required.  \r\nWe present experiments of hammerstone and carnivore broken long bones controlling for body size and taxon by using only Cervus canadensis long bones.  We chose North American elk because it represents a size class commonly found at Pleistocene sites.  The breaks were classified as oblique, longitudinal, or transverse after (Villa and Mahieu,1991 and Pickering et al. 2005) and angles measured following the protocol of (Alc\u00e1ntara-Garcia et al. 2006).

Intra- and inter-observer error estimates are made and measurements are compared to 3D models in Rapidform.

These rat remains have the potential to reveal important information about the ecology, environment, and small mammal biodiversity surrounding Liang Bua during the past 100,000 years. Previous work on the rats of Liang Bua indicates at least five genera are represented (Papagomys, Spelaeomys, Komodomys, Paulamys, and Rattus), including species of small, medium, and giant body size. Here we use a suite of twelve metric and nonmetric measures to analyze the calcaneus (n=370) and humerus (n=450) in order to address questions about Liang Bua rat functional morphology, taxonomy, and taphonomy. Multivariate analysis suggests that there is at least one arboreally-adapted and one terrestrially-adapted species present among each size class, based on consistent differences in the size and shape of the heel. Similar clusters are observed based on the humeral measurements, but the expected functional correlation with arboreality or terrestriality of humeral features is less clear. Taphonomic analysis of the bones suggests that an owl (Tyto sp.) is the likely primary accumulating agent based on characteristic digestive etchings and breakage patterns observed. However, some elements range outside the digestive capacity for owls, suggesting an additional, large avian predator is responsible, probably either the vulture or Marabou stork known from the late Pleistocene deposits.

Analysis of heat-altered micromammalian bone from the layer substantiates claims of cultivated fire-use well inside the cave. Taphonomic analysis conducted on micromammalian remains (individuals &lt; 5kg in weight) from within, above, and below the thermally-altered layer indicates that in this layer the temperature reached 550-600&ordm;C (unlikely to have been caused by a bush fire encroaching on the cave). The intensity of heating is evidenced by drastic discolouration of small-mammal bones. Five grades of heat-induced discolouration were recognized through the sample, with only 3% of category 5 (calcined) bone occurring outside the burnt layer. Electron microscopy of bone fragments attributes this discolouration to burning rather than post-depositional mineral staining (however, a distinctive form of manganese staining has been recognized throughout the sample). Interpretation of the agent responsible for the micromammal sample accumulation, based on element representation, breakage patterning and acid etching, suggests that these bones were deposited by avian predators prior to the burning event. Human intervention is demonstrated by presence of thermally-altered struck flakes and cores of chert excavated in the same layer, and human curation of fire can be inferred. There is little evidence of post-depositional movement or dispersal, and limited weathering and root-etching on the bones sampled.

With this in mind, we developed an experimental approach for the evaluation of skill in representative drawing, a common form of Upper Paleolithic art. First, we developed a set of criteria that can be used to evaluate drawing skill. Then, we asked 30 subjects with varying amounts of experience to produce drawings and provide an estimate of their hours of practice. Next, the subjects&rsquo; drawings were scored with the evaluation criteria. Lastly, we regressed the scores for the drawings on hours of practice.

The assemblage is noteworthy in two important ways: 1) extraordinary preservation characterized by partially articulated skeletons; and 2) remarkable absence of accumulator tooth marks and/or hammerstone percussion breakage. The lack of taphonomically distinct marks suggests that there was no systematic collection of bones by a biotic, bone-accumulating agent. Only approximately 10% of the assemblage exhibits trauma, which may be consistent with a low energy fall or impact; none of the bovid remains have perimortem trauma consistent with a fall from significant height. Moreover, a majority of the bovid long bone remains demonstrate breakages consistent with dry fractures such as right fracture angles and transverse outlines. Finally, the bones exhibit post mortem and post fossilization fractures including crushing, splintering, and cracking; these breakage patterns suggest that there was sediment loading consistent with movement of the surrounding matrix.

During times of resource stress, the coasts acted as refugia to earlier members of our species by providing stable supplies. But the subcontinent has another major aquatic feature that, despite stretching 2200 km across virtually the entire country, has received far less attention: the Orange-Senqu River. Rising from the subcontinent&rsquo;s highest peaks and coursing through some of its most arid regions, the Orange-Senqu would have oscillated with Late Pleistocene climate changes between a useful corridor and a vital lifeline. Our project targets opposite ends of this inland fluvial artery: highland Lesotho where its headwaters rise, and the Namaqualand desert where it empties into the Atlantic. In this paper, we employ radiometric, geoarchaeological and paleoenvironmental data to generate a hypothesis of how the Orange-Senqu River variably influenced Late Pleistocene population dynamics. Specifically, during glacial periods conditions were relatively humid in Namaqualand due to westward shifts of the arid coastal belt, but dry and cold in highland Lesotho. We predict that Namaqualand groups would have been untethered from the river and ranged widely over a relatively productive landscape, whereas Lesotho would have been largely abandoned due to lowered temperatures. Our findings indicate dense occupation of Namaqualand during MIS 4 and 2, whereas exploitation of Lesotho is only ephemeral, particularly during the extreme cold of the LGM. MIS 3, on the other hand, is a period of great instability with rapid humid/arid oscillations throughout the subcontinent. This may have tethered people to the river in both regions in order to reduce the risk of losing access to fresh water and dependent resources. This is largely corroborated by our data, although MIS 3 occupations in Lesotho were more dense and continuous while in Namaqualand ephemeral occupation pulses coincide with brief humid phases.</p>\r\n", "created": "2013-12-03", "comments": "We would like to apologize for submitting this abstract one day late.

However, recent comparative and fossil evidence suggests that African ape locomotor specializations may have evolved in parallel arguing against a suspensory, knuckle-walking LCA. The existence of such substantial homoplasy may seem unlikely. Yet, when compared to other adaptive radiations, in anole lizards, stickleback fish, and even fruit flies, this degree of recurrent evolution is unremarkable. In addition, recent advances in evo-devo have begun to identify the genetic and developmental mechanisms underlying evolutionary change in numerous species including humans. In many cases the independent evolution of similar phenotypes commonly involves the reuse of a narrow set of genes and developmental pathways. Genetic and developmental biases such as the topology of gene regulatory networks, co-option of regulatory modules, and shared standing genetic variation can facilitate repeated phenotypic evolution. Thus, consideration of the role these factors have played in other adaptive radiations are crucial to understanding hominoid evolution. Preexisting mammalian regulatory architecture in the form of Hox&rsquo;s role in determining skeletal growth and vertebral segment identity and the identification of individual genetic enhancers modulating rib curvature, shows that key hominoid features such as elongated forelimbs, shortened lumbar spine, and broadened thorax can be highly evolvable. Thus, extensive genetic diversity combined with homologous genetic makeup and organizational biases in ancestral hominoids could foster parallel phenotypic evolution in the face of similar selective pressures across multiple lineages. These results indicate that despite involving appreciable homoplasy, models proposing parallel evolution in African apes are feasible when considered within larger developmental, ecological, and paleontological contexts.</p>\r\n", "created": "2013-12-05", "comments": "", "abstract_media": "", "last_modified": "2014-04-04", "contact_email": "philreno@psu.edu", "abstract_rank": null, "year": 2014, "references": "", "acknowledgements": "", "meeting": 23}}, {"pk": 106, "model": "meetings.abstract", "fields": {"accepted": true, "funding": true, "presentation_type": "Paper", "title": "A reconsideration of the ochre artifact assemblage from J.D.

The site was first excavated by J. Desmond Clark in 1954-56; more recent excavations by Lawrence Barham (1990s) yielded evidence of extensive collection and utilization of mineral pigments from Middle Pleistocene Lupemban and later contexts. Although Clark&rsquo;s publications on Twin Rivers acknowledged the presence of ochre, little consideration was given to ochre modification type and mineralogical identity. In the study presented here, we examined all examples of ochreous minerals preserved in the J.D. Clark Twin Rivers collection at the Stone Age Institute (Bloomington, Indiana). A total of 195 pieces of putative ochre were identified by visual inspection and their dimensions, mass, mineralogy, color, Mohs hardness, and modification type were recorded. Each piece was also assigned a score for the criteria &lsquo;Pigment Probability&rsquo; and &lsquo;Modification Probability&rsquo;. This study confirms Barham&rsquo;s conclusion that the visually striking mineral specularite is an important element of the ochre assemblage at Twin Rivers. However, our results also indicate that non-specular iron ore was the most common component of the ochre assemblage from Clark&rsquo;s excavation and was utilized differently from specularite. Artifacts classified as Definitely Pigment, Definitely Modified, and made of non-specular iron ore outnumbered (n=29) those classified as Definitely Pigment, Definitely Modified, and made of specularite (n=20). Non-specular iron ore was predominantly knapped into flakes while specularite was ground or scraped as frequently as it was flaked, calling into question the common interpretation that any streakable, iron-rich mineral can be equated with pigment. Putative ochre made of weathered mafic rock was also common but may represent post-depositional weathering of an iron-rich rock originally collected and modified for non-pigment purposes.</p>\r\n", "created": "2013-12-06", "comments": "Secondary author affiliations:\r\n\r\n-Andrew M.

While precise records of developmental defects may provide key insights into human evolution, very few studies have examined the teeth of individuals of known histories. In this study we determined the timing of developmental defects on casts and in histological sections of nine captive juvenile rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta), two captive juvenile pig-tailed macaques (Macaca nemestrina), and three juvenile wild chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes verus), which where compared to medical and/or behavioral records of potential developmental stressors. Hypoplasias are uncommon in the permanent molar crowns of these individuals, but internal accentuated lines are common in postnatal enamel and dentine. We find that teeth are particularly sensitive recorders of diarrheal illnesses, as well as medical procedures. It does not appear that the normative cessation of lactation leaves a consistent or marked developmental defect in molar crowns. Finally, a ten-year record of developmental defects in the Ta&iuml; Forest wild chimpanzees does not correspond to local patterns of rainfall, fruit availability, or epidemic illnesses observed in this community.

Apparent saltation events (rapid cranial capacity increases) have been linked to changes in hominin ecology and behavior mediated by variables that include climate, stone tool morphology, diet, language, sociality, etc. However, the existence of these saltation events has not been rigorously demonstrated. Most studies investigating the rate and pattern of hominin cranial capacity evolution are qualitative and neglect the error associated with radiometric dating and measurement of cranial capacity. We address these issues by presenting a novel quantitative approach in which three evolutionary models (random walk, phyletic gradualism, and punctuated equilibria/stasis) are fit to the data via maximum likelihood; the relative merit of each model is then assessed using the modified Akaike Information Criterion. Monte Carlo methods are used to incorporate radiometric dating errors in the model selection procedure, while ANOVA is used to partition variance in replicate cranial capacity measurements to attain specimen measurement error. We focus on the period from 3.5 to 0.5 million years ago, encompassing the emergence of Homo and other key grade shifts within the hominin clade. The phyletic gradualism model is overwhelmingly supported by our analyses. This suggests that the correlation of external events with &ldquo;saltations&rdquo; in hominin cranial capacity evolution are likely to be spurious. Among geographic regions, there is mixed support for the random walk, phyletic gradualism, and punctuated equilibria/stasis models, which suggests different evolutionary dynamics across lineages and regions. This novel analysis provides a rigorous quantitative approach to this long-standing question and offers new insight into the patterns of hominin cranial capacity evolution at different spatial (global vs. regional) and evolutionary (within vs. among lineages) scales.</p>\r\n", "created": "2013-12-06", "comments": "", "abstract_media": "", "last_modified": "2014-04-04", "contact_email": "andrewdu@gwmail.gwu.edu", "abstract_rank": null, "year": 2014, "references": "", "acknowledgements": "", "meeting": 23}}, {"pk": 26, "model": "meetings.author", "fields": {"first_name": "Andrew", "last_name": "Bishop", "author_rank": 1, "country": "United States of America", "abstract": 26, "department": "School of Human Evolution and Social Change", "email_address": "abishop05@gmail.com", "institution": "Arizona State University", "name": "Andrew Bishop"}}, {"pk": 27, "model": "meetings.author", "fields": {"first_name": "Kim", "last_name": "Hill", "author_rank": 2, "country": "United States of America", "abstract": 26, "department": "School of Human Evolution and Social Change", "email_address": "kim.hill@asu.edu", "institution": "Arizona State University", "name": "Kim Hill"}}, {"pk": 28, "model": "meetings.author", "fields": {"first_name": "Phillip", "last_name": "Bishop", "author_rank": 3, "country": "United States of America", "abstract": 26, "department": "Department of Kinesiology", "email_address": "pbishop@bamaed.ua.edu", "institution": "The University of Alabama", "name": "Phillip Bishop"}}, {"pk": 29, "model": "meetings.author", "fields": {"first_name": "Joan Garcia", "last_name": "Garriga", "author_rank": 1, "country": "Spain", "abstract": 27, "department": "", "email_address": "jgarc338@xtec.cat", "institution": "Institut Catal\u00e0 de Paleoecologia Humana i Evoluci\u00f3 Social (IPHES)", "name": "Joan Garcia Garriga"}}, {"pk": 30, "model": "meetings.author", "fields": {"first_name": "Kenneth Mart\u00ednez", "last_name": "Molina", "author_rank": 2, "country": "Spain", "abstract": 27, "department": "", "email_address": "kmartine@xtec.cat", "institution": "Institut Catal\u00e0 de Paleoecologia Humana i Evoluci\u00f3 Social (IPHES)", "name": "Kenneth Mart\u00ednez Molina"}}, {"pk": 31, "model": "meetings.author", "fields": {"first_name": "Jennifer Midori", "last_name": "Miller", "author_rank": 1, "country": "Canada", "abstract": 28, "department": "Anthropology", "email_address": "jmiller6@ualberta.ca", "institution": "University of Alberta", "name": "Jennifer Midori Miller"}}, {"pk": 32, "model": "meetings.author", "fields": {"first_name": "Andrey", "last_name": "Vyshedskiy", "author_rank": 1, "country": "United States of America", "abstract": 29, "department": "Biology", "email_address": "theandreyv@gmail.com", "institution": "Boston University", "name": "Andrey Vyshedskiy"}}, {"pk": 33, "model": "meetings.author", "fields": {"first_name": "John F", "last_name": "Hoffecker", "author_rank": 1, "country": "United States of America", "abstract": 30, "department": "INSTAAR", "email_address": "John.Hoffecker@colorado.edu", "institution": "University of Colorado at Boulder", "name": "John F Hoffecker"}}, {"pk": 34, "model": "meetings.author", "fields": {"first_name": "Scott A.", "last_name": "Elias", "author_rank": 2, "country": "United Kingdom", "abstract": 30, "department": "Department of Geography", "email_address": "S.Elias@rhul.ac.uk", "institution": "Royal Holloway, University of London", "name": "Scott A.
